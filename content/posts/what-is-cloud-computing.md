The cloud became a pretty familiar term in this day and age. However, there is
a precise definition and a set of criteria that formally define what cloud
computing really is. So, in this article I briefly go over these criteria,
which I believe are important to know for people working with the cloud or
studying to get certified. They may be interesting to know for other people as
well.

The content is directly based on the [NIST definition of cloud
computing](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
and includes other topics like service models and deployment models, which I go
over here as well.

## Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

There are five criteria that must apply to a service in order to be considered
cloud computing. In the subsections below you will see each one of them with a
direct quote from the NIST document followed by my attempt to simplify it.

### 1. On-Demand Self-Service

> A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server
> time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human
> interaction with each service provider.

Let's break this down into two parts:

- The "on-demand" part is apparent from the fact that we can launch most
resources on AWS like EC2 instances, Lambda functions, S3 buckets, etc. right
away and as many times as possible.

- The "self-service" part is about being able to launch those resources without
the need for submitting requests or any form of human interaction. As long as
you have access to the AWS APIs through the UI console or the CLI, you're good
to go.

### 2. Broad Network Access

> Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard
> mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms
> (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations)

This one simply means that cloud services like AWS are accessible by any device
that is connected to the internet.

### 3. Resource Pooling

> The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
> using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources
> dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a
> sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control
> or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be
> able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country,
> state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing,
> memory, and network bandwidth.

This can also be broken into two parts:

- Resource pooling and multi-tenancy mean that AWS manages infrastructure
resources that are available to multiple customers. In other words, multiple
customers can have isolated AWS resources that actually share the same
underlying physical infrastructure.

- Location independence in the case of AWS means that when we as customers
launch AWS resources, we don't know exactly which data center contains these
deployed resources. However, we interact with AWS at more abstract levels,
which are regions, availability zones (AZs), and edge locations.

To put this in an (oversimplified) example, AWS has servers with with huge
amounts of storage and compute power. On each one of those servers is a way of
creating smaller virtual machines (VMs). When you launch an EC2 instance of a
certain type (e.g. t2.micro), you're creating one such VM that runs on one of
those servers. You can specify the region and AZ in which this VM resides
(e.g., us-east-1a), but that does not inform you exactly which data center has
your VM running. The lowest level you can manage with EC2 is AZs.

### 4. Rapid Elasticity

> Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
> automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
> To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to
> be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time

Elasticity here refers to scaling out (adding resources) and in (removing
resources) according to the current demand. A prime example of this is EC2 and
auto scaling groups, which can be configured to add or remove EC2 instances
based on usage. The ability to scale out means that we can ensure higher
availability for our applications, and the ability to scale in means that we
don't have unnecessary resources running. This also ties into the next point.

### 5. Measured Service

> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a
> metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of
> service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
> Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing
> transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

The main idea of this point is that all forms of resource usage are measured
from both billing and monitoring perspectives. Most cloud resources follow a
pay-as-you-go pricing model. Together with elasticity, this eliminates the need
for over-provisioning and makes costs reflect actual usage. The monitoring and
reporting capabilities also are useful for logging, compliance, audit trails,
etc.
